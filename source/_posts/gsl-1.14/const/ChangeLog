	* const.el: removed electromagnetic constants from cgs, now only
	in CGSM

2008-07-03  Brian Gough  <bjg@hp2.network-theory.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): use top_srcdir instead of top_builddir

2006-03-21  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test.c (main): added some extra tests

2006-03-17  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (gsl-electrical-constants): added debye unit

2004-05-26  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test.c: added stdlib.h for exit()

2004-03-05  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el: added CGS and MKS systems back in, with CGSM electrical
	units excluded from CGS, for backwards compatibility

	* const.el (gsl-constants): added stefan-boltzmann constant and
	thomson cross section

2003-09-18  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test.c: added a test program

	* gsl_const.h: fixed to use new header files for MKSA and CGSM

2003-06-09  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* calc-units-update.el: changed to use MKSA and CGSM units, so
	that electromagnetic constants are converted correctly

	* calc-units-update.el (math-additional-units): Add this file to
	provide updated costants for Emacs calc.  (These values are in the
	current development versions of GNU Emacs and Xemacs already.)
