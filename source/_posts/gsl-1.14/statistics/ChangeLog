	* Function Name Reorganization: The function suffix "_with_mean"
<<<<<<< 2157652494b7e03d4345b81d263b74e6846f75d8
 	has been changed to "_m", the function suffix "_with_mean_and_sd"
 	has been changed to "_m_sd". The variance function est_variance
 	has been changed to simply _variance, (similarly for est_sd, which
 	is now _sd), while the function _variance is now
 	_variance_with_fixed_mean (and _sd is _sd_with_fixed_mean).
