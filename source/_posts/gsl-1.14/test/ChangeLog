	* results.c: now displayed PASS lines only if GSL_TEST_VERBOSE=1,
	otherwise only display fail lines by default.

	* results.c (gsl_test_rel): catch NaN
	(gsl_test_abs): catch NaN

	* results.c (gsl_test_factor): added a test for two results being
<<<<<<< 2157652494b7e03d4345b81d263b74e6846f75d8
 	within a given factor of each other (e.g. "result should be good
 	to within a factor of 2").  Note that this is different from the
 	definition of relative error, which starts with a measurement of
 	the difference by subtraction.
